					The Classical Waterfall Model is a traditional and sequential 
					approach to software development that divides the process into 
					distinct phases, where the output of each phase serves as the 
					input for the next phase. It's called "waterfall" because the 
					progress flows steadily downwards, like a waterfall, through 
					these phases without revisiting previous stages once they are 
					completed.
